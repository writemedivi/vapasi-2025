## üìò Concept Breakdown

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Association

**Definition:**  
Association represents a "has-a" relationship between two or more classes.  
This is a loosely coupled relationship where both entities can exist independently.

**Example Scenario:**
- A `Library` has a list of `Book` objects.
- A `Student` can be associated with a `Department`.

**File:**  
`association/AssociationDemo.java`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exception Handling

**Definition:**  
Exception handling allows a program to deal with unexpected events (errors) gracefully using try-catch blocks.

**Key Concepts:**
- `try-catch-finally`
- `throw` and `throws`
- Custom exception classes

**Example Scenario:**
- Throw `InvalidAgeException` if a user inputs age below 18 for voter registration.

**File:**  
`exception/CustomExceptionDemo.java`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multilevel Inheritance

**Definition:**  
In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.  
This creates a parent ‚Üí child ‚Üí grandchild chain.

**Example Scenario:**
- `GrandParent` ‚Üí `Parent` ‚Üí `Child`  
  Each level adds or overrides behavior from the previous.

**File:**  
`inheritance/MultilevelInheritanceDemo.java`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism

**Definition:**  
Polymorphism enables methods to behave differently based on the object context.  
It includes:

- **Compile-time Polymorphism:** Method overloading
- **Runtime Polymorphism:** Method overriding using inheritance

**Example Scenario:**
- A `Shape` class has a `draw()` method.
  - `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` each override `draw()` with their specific implementation.

**File:**  
`polymorphism/PolymorphismDemo.java`
